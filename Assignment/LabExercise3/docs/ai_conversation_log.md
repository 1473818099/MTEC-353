Why include juce_core instead of just <iostream>?

Short answer: iostream only gives you C++ streams; JUCE code uses JUCE types (e.g., juce::String, juce::Array, juce::Time, juce::File, juce::Logger) that live in juce_core. If your code includes juce::String (as in your assignment), you must link juce_core.

What juce_core gives you that <iostream> doesn’t:

Foundational JUCE types: juce::String, juce::Array, juce::var, juce::Identifier

Utilities: juce::Range, juce::OptionalScopedPointer, juce::HashMap

System & files: juce::File, juce::Time, juce::Process, juce::MemoryBlock

Cross-platform consistency (Windows/macOS/Linux) for strings, files, time, threading, etc.

In your code:

#include <juce_core/juce_core.h>  // needed for juce::String, juce::Array, etc.
#include <iostream>               // still fine for std::cout

juce::String msg("Hello from JUCE");
std::cout << msg << std::endl;    // works because juce_core defines conversions/ops


In CMake, you must link the module:

target_link_libraries(LabExercise3 PRIVATE juce::juce_core)


If you omit it, you’ll get unresolved symbol errors for JUCE classes even if the header compiles.

What does juce_add_console_app do?

Short answer: It’s a JUCE CMake helper that creates a console application target and wires up JUCE the right way (include dirs, defines, platform flags, module glue, etc.), so you don’t have to hand-write all the boilerplate.

What it sets up (simplified):

Defines a target with the right subsystem (console) and entry point (your main()).

Adds JUCE include paths, compile definitions (e.g., JUCE_GLOBAL_MODULE_SETTINGS_INCLUDED), and platform flags.

Integrates JUCE’s module system so linking juce::juce_core works properly.

Keeps things cross-platform (macOS/Linux/Windows) without you writing per-OS logic.

Your minimal usage:

juce_add_console_app(LabExercise3
    PRODUCT_NAME "LabExercise3"
)

target_sources(LabExercise3 PRIVATE src/Main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(LabExercise3 PRIVATE juce::juce_core)


Could you do it manually with add_executable? Yes—but you’d need to replicate a bunch of platform/define/module setup. The helper avoids subtle build issues.

Why set JUCE_DIR myself?

Short answer: JUCE isn’t installed system-wide; it’s just a cloned folder in your workspace. CMake can’t “auto-find” arbitrary source directories unless the project installs a package config or you point CMake to it. Setting JUCE_DIR tells CMake where JUCE’s CMakeLists.txt lives so add_subdirectory(${JUCE_DIR}) can bring JUCE into your build.

Typical setup in your project:

# Path to your local JUCE clone (adjust this)
set(JUCE_DIR "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../JUCE" CACHE PATH "Path to JUCE")

add_subdirectory(${JUCE_DIR} JUCE)   # now targets like juce::juce_core exist


Common alternatives (when you don’t want to hardcode a path):

Pass it at configure time:

cmake -B build -DJUCE_DIR=/Users/you/Dev/JUCE


Use an environment variable and read it in CMake:

set(JUCE_DIR $ENV{JUCE_DIR} CACHE PATH "Path to JUCE")


Use FetchContent (downloads JUCE at configure time), but that’s slower and not always desired for coursework.


Why CMake can’t “just detect it”:

find_package(JUCE) only works if JUCE is installed with a package config that CMake can discover (via CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH/system paths). A raw git clone doesn’t expose itself that way. Hence: you point to it.

If you want, I can add a tiny path check to your CMakeLists.txt that throws a friendly error when JUCE_DIR is wrong, plus a suggestion on how to set it.
